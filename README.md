Guess the correct word Game in Python
</h1>

<p>
It is another fun game made using the randint function of the random module. In this game, the user needs to blindly enter the alphabet through which the user gets to the word. You will have limited chances and it would be fun to guess the correct word before you are out of chances! All the best!!
